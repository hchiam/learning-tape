Learning Tape for JS TDD.

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

## Get Started:
To get started, do this inside your folder within Terminal:
```
npm install tape --save-dev
```

## Run Test:
Then to run the test, do this in Terminal:
```
node test.js
```

This tests `add.js` using `add.test.js`.

And you should see something like this:
```
TAP version 13
# The add method
ok 1 should add two numbers correctly

1..1
# tests 1
# pass  1

# ok
```
